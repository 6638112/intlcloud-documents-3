This document describes the backup and rollback fees.

## Billing
- **Backup storage space**: Backup files take up the storage space. Backup modes include automatic and manual, and backup objects include binlog and data. Storage space used by all backup files incurs fees under this billable item.
>?The backup storage space is free of charge for now, and we will notify you of future billing changes.
- **Rollback**: TDSQL-C for MySQL supports rollback to the original cluster or a new cluster according to the backup file or time point. The former doesn't incur fees, while the latter incurs fees after the new cluster is generated. For billing details, see [Product Pricing](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1098/48406).
